# tool-evaluation-kit-demo
Demo for a simple tool evaluation kit.

A lightweight, repeatable approach for evaluating enterprise tools using weighted criteria.
This repository aims to demonstrate structured thinking, basic automation and clear documentation.

## Purpose
Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Business Process Management (BPM) initiatives often require
transparent and repeatable tool evaluations. This kit provides a simple template for that process.

## What this demonstrates
- Defining and weighting evaluation criteria
- Automating score aggregation with Python
- Producing both machine-readable and human-readable outputs

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python evaluate.py
